                            <p class="text-box">Howdy! My name is Ryan Mok. I am born and raised in Lincolnwood, IL, which is a northern suburb
                                of Chicago that nearly everyone has never heard of. I am currently enrolled in Northwestern
                                University's full-stack coding program where I am learning how to become a web-developer.
                                Aside from working full time and attending class, most of my free time is spent either being
                                with my childhood friends, going to the gym, cooking, playing video games, or playing my
                                saxophone.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-box"> I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014 where I received my Bachelor's
                                of Fine Arts in Music; I was and still am a fairly large music nerd. I was very active in
                                the athletic bands program which included a Marching, Volleyball, and Basketball Band that
                                performed at every home game; I joined mostly becasue a lot of my friends were also in them.
                                University ensembles aside, I started an ad-hoc ensemble known as Sixth Street Brass. Most
                                of our music can be classified as "riot-jazz", but we also wrote arrangements of popular
                                music such as "No-Diggity" by Blackstreet (we found a way to make it work).</p>
                            <p class="text-box">I look at the coding world as I would music; there's an order to it, there's a million ways to
                                produce results, and there's always something new and refreshing being released to the public.</p>
